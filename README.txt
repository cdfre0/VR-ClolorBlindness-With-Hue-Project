Welcome to my VR project. 

It was made for VR course I took during my exchange year in City University of Hong Kong 2022-2023, and since then I polished it and improved.

To run the program:
	1. Download 5.1 Unreal Engine from Epic Store
	2. Download project
	3. Connect VR set (It should work with any, I used Oculus Quest) 
	4. Open Unreal Engine app
	5. Click on "Browse..." button (button on the bottom)
	6. Search for the folder You downloaded project and select "HueProject.uproject", confirm by "Open" button
	7. After loading, new window should open. To play, click on 3 dots icon next to play button and choose "VR Preview" (if you cannot select this option, it means your VR set is not connected properly)

Goal of Application: I have implemented "Farnsworth Munsell 100 Hue Test", which helps user to detect if they suffer from color blindness. One is meant to put each cake in a box, so that color of them will smoothly go from one to the other, from left to right. Submit set of cakes by pressing the button. There are 4 sets, each with different colors. After each round button needs to be clicked. After all sets, result will be displayed.
